            <p>Booking a trip through a travel agency involves visiting or contacting the agency with your travel preferences, including destination, dates, budget, and any specific requirements. The agent provides tailored options for transportation, accommodations, and activities, often bundling them into a package deal. Once you choose a package, the agent handles the reservations and payments. Finally, they provide you with an itinerary and all necessary documents, ensuring a hassle-free travel experience.</p>

                  The process of obtaining a visa through a travel agency typically starts with the traveler providing the agency with their travel details, including destination, dates, and the type of visa needed. The agency will then assist in gathering the required documents, filling out the visa application, and submitting it to the relevant embassy or consulate. The agency may also schedule appointments or interviews, handle payment of visa fees, and track the application status. Once the visa is approved, the agency provides the traveler with the necessary documents, ensuring a smooth and stress-free experience.</p>
